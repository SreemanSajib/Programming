# Make Python program which does the following steps:

#     Prompt user to insert
#         A word
#         A character
#     Find if the character exists in the word. Possible prints below.
#         Word "{WordFirst}" contains character "{Character}"
#         Word "{WordFirst}" doesn't contain character "{Character}"
#     Prompt user to insert one more word
#     Compare the first word to the second word. Examples below:
#         The first word "{WordFirst}" is before the second word "{WordSecond}" alphabetically.
#         The second word "{WordSecond}" is before the first word "{WordFirst}" alphabetically.
#         Both inserted words are the same alphabetically, "{WordFirst}"
# Program starting.
print("Program starting.")
# String comparisons
print("String comparisons")
# Insert first word: beans
Word1 = input("Insert first word: ")
# Insert a character: n
Character = input("Insert a character: ")
# Word "beans" contains character "n"
if Character in Word1:
    print(f"Word \"{Word1}\" contains character \"{Character}\"")
else:
    print(f"Word \"{Word1}\" doesn't contain character \"{Character}\"")
# Insert second word: banana
Word2 = input("Insert second word: ")
# The second word "banana" is before the first word "beans" alphabetically.
if(Word1 <  Word2):
    print(f"The first word \"{Word1}\" is before the second word \"{Word2}\" alphabetically.")
elif(Word1 > Word2): 
    print(f"The second word \"{Word2}\" is before the first word \"{Word1}\" alphabetically.")


# Program ending.
print("Program ending.")
